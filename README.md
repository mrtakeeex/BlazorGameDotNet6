# BlazorGameDotNet6

Full-stack .NET 6 WebAssembly battle game application. User can register and login, build an army and fight with other users from the leaderboard.
My very first application, which was implemented mainly for learning purposes and to face new challenges.
Using the latest .NET technologies including C# 10, EF Core, Blazor and asyncronous programming with API Controller requests.
This is a stabil build, although it still has a lot of potential, which will possibly come later (xUnit, MudBlazor, more features, et cetera)
